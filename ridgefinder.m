% Description:
% The signal that has been transformed into a wavelet domain can be thought
% of as a surface with peaks and valleys. The peaks of a signal often
% persists across several scales, creating ridges. These ridges can be
% identified and the peak of each ridge, too. These ridges and peaks offer
% a more condensed description of a wavelet transform and can indicate the
% presence of an interesting feature in the original waveform.

%methods.

%Simple Peak Finding Method: Scan a signal with a window. Find the max. If the max is greater
%than the left and right endpoints of the window it is a peak candidate.
%The window is centered at each point of a waveform, so a wider peak
%candidate will recieve more votes in a sense. If a window has more than
%one point with the max value then the left most index is used. A downside
%to this method is that it is sensitive to the size of the window. However,
%this seeming limitation is actually put to use in the wavelet method by
%scaling the window along with the wavelet.
